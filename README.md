# Diablo 2 Waypoint enabler

## Description

This single page application will update your character file so that all waypoints (except one) will be enabled.

It is used for testing the game when it is started with the `-act5` command line option

For Diablo 2 Resurrected this option is not available.
Instead, you should enable the checkbox below to bring a characters stats up to Level 33

A limitation of this application is that you should ensure you have activated at least 1 way point before trying to apply this patcher.
Also your .d2s file must be at least 1024 bytes in size, so place some items in your stash or inventory first
